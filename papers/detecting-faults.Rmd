abstract:  "The way to open data to citizens so that they can take their own decisions as well as create applications and studies based on it goes through ensuring that the data can be trusted. After a hackathon where we studied the environmental sensors in the city of Granada, we found oddities in the data sequences. In this paper we present several methods to study those oddities or possible faults that could eventually be used to invalidate data provided by smart city or other sensors"
