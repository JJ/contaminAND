abstract:  "The way to open data to citizens so that they can take their own decisions as well as create applications and studies based on it goes through ensuring that the data can be trusted. After a hackathon where we studied the environmental sensors in the city of Granada, we found oddities in the data sequences. In this paper we present several methods to study those oddities or possible faults that could eventually be used to invalidate data provided by smart city or other sensors"

# Introduction

The whole point of the open data movement is to keep the
administration in check so that the citizens can take informed
decisions about their continuity, but it is also about reusing data
provided by the administration for their own economic, health or
political benefit.

The first step of opening data is obtaining data provided by the
administration via freeing it from proprietary formats or simply
documents that prevent quantitative or qualitative analysis of the
data. In this first step, we should believe that the only source of
errors or *noise* is the extraction process and that data itself is
clean and should be trusted, since it arrives from qualified sources
or calibrated sensors.

During the beginning of the month of March 2017, we initiated a
process that extracted air quality information from pages hosted by
the regional government, the Junta de Andaluc√≠a. After some
visualization, we realized long sequences of measurements that yielded
exactly the same number and other changes that did not seem have
correlation with reality.

This paper in an attempt to present a methodology that would find
problems in time series of environmental measurements via a series of
statistical analysis. After a brief presentation of the state of the
art, we show the results of the initial data exploration we performed,
followed by the different techniques used to analyze the possibility
that the data was faulty. Finally, we will present our conclusions.
