abstract:  "After a hackathon where we studied data gathered from the
environmental sensors in the city of Granada and other cities in
Andalucia, we found several oddities in the data sequences, which
makes us doubt the veracity of published data. In this paper we
present several methods to study those oddities or possible faults
that could eventually be used to validate data provided by smart
city sensors or other kind of data providers."

# Introduction

The whole point of the open data movement is to keep the
administration in check so that the citizens can take informed
decisions about their continuity, but it is also about reusing data
provided by the administration for their own economic, health or
political benefit.

The first step of opening data is obtaining data provided by the
administration via freeing it from proprietary formats or simply
documents that prevent quantitative or qualitative analysis of the
data. In this first step, we should believe that the only source of
errors or *noise* is the extraction process and that data itself is
clean and should be trusted, since it arrives from qualified sources
or calibrated sensors.

During the beginning of the month of March 2017, we initiated a
process that extracted air quality information from pages hosted by
the regional government, the Junta de Andaluc√≠a. After some
visualization, we realized long sequences of measurements that yielded
exactly the same number and other changes that did not seem have
correlation with reality.

This paper in an attempt to present a methodology that would find
problems in time series of environmental measurements via a series of
statistical analysis. After a brief presentation of the state of the
art, we show the results of the initial data exploration we performed,
followed by the different techniques used to analyze the possibility
that the data was faulty. Finally, we will present our conclusions.

# State of the art

Surprisingly enough, there is very little literature in this area,
probably due to the fact that the open data movement is relatively
recent. Most papers are devoted to finding evidences of fraud in
financial data [@fanning1998neural,@5522816]. However, we have found no
published research that tries to find evidence of faulty sensors or
faulty processing that leads to statistical oddities in the published
data.
